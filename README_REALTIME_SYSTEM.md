Your VideoLLM project has been enhanced with a comprehensive real-time traffic monitoring system for live traffic analysis, accident detection, and violation monitoring.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Run Demo Mode (Default Camera)
```bash
python realtime_traffic_monitor.py --demo
```

### 3. Monitor Specific Cameras
```bash
python realtime_traffic_monitor.py --cameras 0 1 2
```

### 4. Monitor RTSP Streams (IP Cameras)
```bash
python realtime_traffic_monitor.py --rtsp rtsp://camera1.local/stream rtsp://camera2.local/stream
```
