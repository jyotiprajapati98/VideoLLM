## üöÄ How to Use

### **Step 1: Upload and Process Video**
1. Start your VideoLLM system:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   python run_server.py
   
   # Terminal 2  
   python run_ui.py
   ```

2. Upload your video through the web interface at `http://localhost:8501`

3. Wait for processing to complete (you'll see enhanced Q&A analysis in the results)

### **Step 2: Ask Q&A Questions**
Once your video is processed, you can ask any of the supported question types. The system will automatically:

- **Detect Q&A Style**: Recognize when you're asking analytical questions
- **Provide Multiple Choice Format**: Give answers in A/B/C format when appropriate
- **Include Analysis**: Show confidence scores and reasoning
- **Reference Timestamps**: Point to specific moments in the video

### **Step 3: Example Interaction**

**User**: "What is the most significant, unexpected event that occurs partway through the video?"

**AI Response**:
```
üö∂ Most Significant Unexpected Event:

At 32.8 seconds, the most significant unexpected event occurs:

Answer: B) A pedestrian runs across the road in front of the camera.

üìã Analysis:
- Event detected with high confidence
- Classified as unexpected due to sudden appearance  
- Significance score: 0.92/1.0
- This event represents the primary unexpected occurrence in the video

Event Description: A pedestrian suddenly runs across the road in front of the camera, crossing from right to left between vehicles...
```

## ‚ö° Advanced Features

### **Temporal Analysis**
Ask questions like:
- "When do the key events happen?"
- "What is the sequence of events?"
- "Show me the timeline of important moments"

### **Detailed Event Analysis**
The system provides:
- **Exact timestamps** for all events
- **Confidence scores** for detection accuracy
- **Significance rankings** for event importance
- **Cause-effect relationships** between events
- **Camera behavior analysis** throughout the video

### **Vehicle and Participant Tracking**
- Identifies all vehicles and people in the video
- Tracks their movements and interactions
- Analyzes the camera vehicle's behavior
- Detects vehicle types and characteristics

## üéØ Example Test Videos

For best results, use videos containing:

1. **Traffic scenarios** with pedestrians crossing
2. **Urban driving** with various vehicle types
3. **Clear, unexpected events** that stand out
4. **Sequential actions** where one event leads to another
5. **Good video quality** for accurate analysis

## üîß Testing Your Setup

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_qa_system.py
```

This will test:
- Q&A question detection
- Answer generation
- Advanced analysis features
- Integration between components

## üìä Enhanced Analysis Output

When you process a video, you'll now see:
- **Traditional traffic analysis** (violations, vehicles, safety)
- **Q&A Analysis section** with:
  - Video summary theme
  - Most significant event details
  - Camera vehicle identification
  - Temporal sequence of events
  - Significance rankings

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Use clear questions**: Follow the example formats for best recognition
2. **Wait for full processing**: The Q&A analysis needs complete video processing
3. **Ask specific questions**: The system works best with focused, analytical questions
4. **Reference the examples**: Use similar phrasing to the demonstration questions
5. **Check the analysis**: Look at the Q&A section in the processing results

Your VideoLLM system is now ready to handle sophisticated video analysis questions! üéâ
